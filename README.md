# week1.day4.spaceInvadersMVP

## Instructions
1. Use command line to create a new project folder called `spaceInvadersMVP`
    - Navigate into the folder and create your required files (`index.html`, `sketch.js`) 
    - Include a reference to p5.js in your `index.html` file
    - Feel free to include additional files according to your needs
2. Follow the plan youâ€™ve made with your group!
3. Keep in mind this will be another MVP - it does NOT need to look perfect.
4. Remember:
    - Setup up a spaceship (perhaps a rectangle) near the bottom of canvas screen.
    - When the user presses the left or right arrow keys, the 'ship' should move in those directions. *(HINT: check out [keyIsDown()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/keyIsDown))*
    - Create alien/enemy ships in the space above the spaceship.
    - When the user presses a particular key, projectiles should head from the spaceship and towards the direction of the alien ships.
    - When a projectile hits an alien ship, both the alien ship and the projectile should be removed from the canvas.
5. **This is a MILESTONE project**
    - **Include the names of each member of your group as a comment at the top of the "sketch.js" file, along with the role each member played**
    - **This project will NOT be graded. It is simply used to gauge how our students are doing during the SI. Check out [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18_SRRPzDNqv_xdeS6oVoNOp80B16-JC3oa4jzwy6GLk/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.**

## Extra Credit
- Recreate classic enemy behavior:
    - The alien ships shoot back at random intervals
    - The alien ships should move left and right constantly (can move together as group)
    - The alien ships should also move downwards towards the spaceship at a slow, but constant pace
    - If any alien ship reaches the end of the canvas, the game should end
- Create a button that allows the user to restart the game
- Keep a running score
